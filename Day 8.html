        <h3>What is Flower</h3>
        <p>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower. These petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes.</p>

    <h3>Uses of Flowers</h3>
    <p>Flowers have multiple commercial uses. From using perfumes as star accents to becoming the centre of decorations, many people profit from them commercially. We have essential oils for body care, such as essential oils, creams, and serums. The food industry also uses them to extract flavors and organic food colourants.</p>
